# Logo-Generator

  ## Description

  - I decided to complete this project because it's a great resource to get an idea on how to generate a quick logo for a project
  - Anyone needing to generate a logo, it's a pretty base model so no one can really utilize this for anything too complex, but it gives a simple idea of what is needed, a few modifications can get this generating some great logos
  - This project specifically I plan on just turning in for a grade, no real use for what I'd like to get into
